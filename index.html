							<div class="features">
								<section class="basketball">
									<h3>My Favorite Pastime</h3>
									<p>Since I was nine years old, I loved the game of basketball. I used to play in our local park and eventually on my own hoop with friends. I also watch the NBA and my favorite team is the Golden State Warriors. For those who are fimiliar with the NBA, it should not surprise you that Steph Curry is my favorite player.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="movie">
									<h3>My Favorite Movie</h3>
									<p>As much as I believe that the original Blade Runner is an exceptional movie, I felt more immersed in the philosophy and world of Blade Runner 2049. The way it handles topics such what it means to be human, what gives us purpose, discrimination, and love is second to none. Denis Villeneuve trully created a masterpiece and it is awesome that he comes from Quebec.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="album">
									<h3>My Favorite Album</h3>
									<p>If you told me I could only listen to one album for the rest of my life, I would choose Currents by Tame Impala. It has a great mix of slow and fast pased songs along with a variety of genres such as indie rock, electropop, R&B, and disco to name a few. My favorite song from the album is Let it Happen. </p>
								</section>
								<section class="world-cup">
									<h3>My Pick To Win The World Cup</h3>
									<p>My pick to win the World Cup is Croatia. I have family that is from there and my country is not represented in the World Cup, therefore it became the team that my family and I root for. Since they ended up runner-ups in 2018, I hope this is the year that they win it all.</p>
